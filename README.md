# 🌐 Web Development Practice Hub

Welcome to my Web Development Practice repository!  
This is a personal space where I upload step-by-step exercises, notes, and mini-projects as I grow my skills in web development. Whether it's working with basic HTML/CSS or diving into full-stack tools like React, Node.js, and beyond — it's all here, organized and easy to revisit.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- 📄 HTML & CSS basics  
- 🧠 JavaScript practice  
- ⚛️ React components and hooks  
- 🔧 Backend experiments (Node.js, Express, etc.)  
- 🧪 Project setups, testing, deployment notes  
- 📚 Reference guides and best practices
